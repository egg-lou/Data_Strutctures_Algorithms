# Introduction to Binary Trees

## Binary Tree Data Structure

A **binary tree** is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used in computer science for tasks such as organizing data, representing hierarchical structures, and implementing efficient algorithms.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of a binary tree as a family tree, where each person has at most two children.

## Binary Tree Characteristics

In a binary tree:
- Each node has a data element and pointers to its left and right children.
- Nodes can have zero, one, or two children.
- Binary trees can be used for various purposes, including searching, sorting, and representing hierarchical relationships.

## Operations

Common operations on binary trees include:

1. **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the tree while maintaining the binary tree properties.
2. **Deletion**: Removing a node from the tree while preserving the binary tree structure.
3. **Traversal**: Visiting all nodes of the tree in a specific order (e.g., inorder, preorder, postorder).
4. **Search**: Finding a specific node with a given value in the tree.
5. **Balancing**: Ensuring the tree remains balanced to maintain efficient search and insertion times.

## Applications

Binary trees have a wide range of applications, including:

- **Search Algorithms**: Binary search trees are used in binary search algorithms.
- **Expression Parsing**: Parsing arithmetic expressions and building expression trees.
- **File Systems**: Organizing files and directories in a hierarchical manner.

## Implementations
